# Vest Exchange

Vest Exchange is a highly capital-efficient perpetual futures exchange that employs zero-knowledge proofs to ensure fair pricing for traders and liquidity providers.

This repository is a frontend clone of the [Vest Exchange](https://trade.vest.exchange/) platform, designed to replicate its user interface and functionality. The backend is a proxy to the Vest Exchange backend, while the websocket communication is handled via Vest's WebSocket API.

For further details, refer to the [Vest API documentation](https://docs.vest.exchange/getting-started/vest-api#get-klines).

> **Note:** This project is for frontend design and learning purposes only. It makes read-only API calls to the Exchange backend, and no actual trading occurs here. The Vest Exchange platform holds the copyright to all associated assets and functionality.

## User Interface

### Actual Vest Design

Note: Some differences may exist due to the use of paid TradingView charts in the original design.

## API

Upon initial load, the following API calls are made:

1. `/ticker/latest` - Retrieves all tickers.
2. `/klines?symbol=ETH-PERP&interval=1m&startTime=1741786231596&endTime=1742391031596&limit=331` - Fetches the chart candlestick data for the specified ticker.
3. `/trades?symbol=ETH-PERP` - Retrieves recent trades for the ticker.

Subsequent real-time updates are fetched via WebSocket:

- `{"method":"SUBSCRIBE","params":["tickers"],"id":1742391031596}` - Subscribe to updated ticker data.
- `{"method":"SUBSCRIBE","params":["ETH-PERP@kline_1m"],"id":1742391031597}` - Subscribe to real-time candlestick data.
- `{"method":"SUBSCRIBE","params":["ETH-PERP@depth"],"id":1742391031598}` - Subscribe to current bids/asks in the order book.
- `{"method":"SUBSCRIBE","params":["ETH-PERP@trades"],"id":1742391031598}` - Subscribe to real-time trades data.

The WebSocket responses are Brotli compressed, and the data is decompressed before being updated in real time.

## Architecture

1. The frontend replicates the Vest Exchange UI design.
2. The candlestick chart is rendered for markets, utilizing both REST and WebSocket APIs to fetch and stream candlestick data in real time.

3. **Other Features:**

   - A dropdown menu allows users to select different markets.

   - Integration with the Solana wallet adapter for the `Connect Wallet` feature.

   - Time interval switching for the candlestick chart.

## Technical Specifications

- Built using **React**, **Node.js**, and **TypeScript**.
- **TradingView's [`lightweight-charts`](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts)** library is used to render the candlestick chart.
